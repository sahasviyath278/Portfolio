<h2 style="color:#6f42c1; margin-top:0;">CAREER OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>As a UCSC Computer Science undergraduate with hands-on Linux sysadmin, networking and infrastructure experience, I am seeking a <strong>System Network Engineering internship</strong> to apply and expand my skills. I have practical experience in services (SSH, FTP), building and testing HA web clusters, capturing and analyzing network traffic, and automating secure backups and monitoring. I aim to contribute to the team while learning from experienced practitioners and applying best practices in a production-like environment.</p>

<h2 style="color:#6f42c1; margin-top:0;">PROJECTS & LAB WORK</h2>

### Linux Server Configuration & Services
- Implemented vsftpd for secure FTP access: configured chroot jails, TLS-based encryption (FTPS), user-specific configs, and permission hardening to limit attack surface.  
- Configured disk quotas to enforce per-user storage limits, monitored usage and automated alerts for quota exceedance.

### DHCP & Network Services
- Implemented DHCP services for dynamic IP allocation in lab topologies; configured leases, reservations, and options for DNS integration.  
- Used GNS3 to simulate network topologies and validate DHCP behavior across VLANs and routed segments.

### Storage Management — RAID & LVM
- Built and managed software RAID arrays (RAID 1, RAID 5 testing) for redundancy; performed simulated drive failures and rebuilds.  
- Used LVM to create flexible volume groups and logical volumes, performed online resizing, snapshots for backups, and mapped LVs to file systems for services.

### Web Cluster — High Availability & Load Balancing
- Designed and deployed a fault-tolerant web cluster where Apache Tomcat served application backends across multiple hosts.  
- Configured Squid as a reverse proxy and caching layer in front of Tomcat backends to load balance requests and reduce backend load. Implemented backend pool configuration and basic health checks.  
- Used <strong>Keepalived</strong> to provide a virtual IP (VIP) through VRRP so that the Squid frontends were highly available; configured failover priorities, failover scripts, and health-check integration with backend status.

### Automation Scripting & Maintenance
- Wrote Bash scripts for automated backups (tar + rotation), log rotation; integrated scripts with cron/systemd timers.
